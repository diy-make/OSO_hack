## Debrief: How Getting Out of the Office at EthGlobal Buenos Aires Reinforced Key Innovation Principles

I recently had a great chat with Juan Bernabó from Agile Brazil (linkedin.com/in/juanbernabo), and so when I did this EthGlobal Buenos Aires hack this weekend, I did so by getting out of the office and hacking at and on the Devconnect music stage. What we thought was a good audience interaction turned out uncool, but a cool interaction was there that we hadn’t thought of and wouldn’t have been able to test (probably not even think of) without getting out of the office and being agile about the build.

Specifically, we planned to use it for tipping QR codes, but it turns out it was way better for me to run around the stage and crowd, taking semi-professional photos and posting those up so that the moments we shared together were already framed as memories in the tiny box. Therefore, we got to play with temporal feedback and nostalgia in the moment. Never would’ve been able to do that without Blank.

I had access to one of the tiny boxes on stage, and that’s where I placed my cheerbot—a Pimoroni Inky 13.3 e-ink display powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero W 2, designed for very long-lasting battery life and a beautiful, analog texture. In the field, these features truly shone: the readability and aesthetic of the e-ink display captured attention subtly yet effectively, the battery endurance ensured continuous operation without interruption, and the tactile, analog feel created an inviting, intimate digital artifact that complemented the live experience. This practical success confirmed part of our thesis—while the QR tipping idea faltered, the cheerbot embodied the richer, more engaging interaction we sought.

Without leaving the building and being agile about my build, this insight would never have come to light. I wouldn’t have even thought about it, let alone tested and validated it. This is a perfect example of what Steve Blank calls Customer Development—getting out there, talking to users, and learning from real-world feedback to improve the product. It’s also deeply tied to Lean Startup principles—build, measure, learn—and Agile, which encourages flexible, iterative development instead of rigid planning.

### Why "Get Out of the Office" Matters

Steve Blank’s methodology teaches that assumptions made inside four walls often miss the mark. Real learning happens in the wild, with actual users. Agile development then helps teams respond quickly to those learnings by iterating in short cycles. Lean Startup ties it all together by focusing on constant testing and adjusting until a product truly fits the market.

### My EthGlobal Experience in This Context

In Buenos Aires, this meant ditching the original plan, experimenting live, and quickly identifying what actually resonated with people. The power wasn’t in the tech alone but in how I connected with the audience by building something that sparked immediate joy and reflection using photos, nostalgia, and the tactile presence of the cheerbot in the tiny stage box.

### Key Takeaways for Business and Innovation

- User-centric discovery starts by talking directly with users, not guessing what they want.
- Rapid iteration lets you pivot away from assumptions that don’t work.
- Embrace surprises—some of the best ideas emerge unexpectedly through real interaction.
- Blend methodologies—Customer Development, Lean, and Agile complement each other toward smarter, grounded innovation.

In sum, if you want to build meaningful products and services, spending more time away from your desk, engaging your users on their terms, and being ready to pivot fast is the winning play. This approach transforms uncertainty into opportunity and creativity into success—just like it did for me in Buenos Aires.
